Created by Justin

Description
-
Dynamic UI is a library for Forge which allows for creation of highly dynamic user 
interfaces using the MVC model. Each user interface is created by creating a new 
class extendingDynamic UI and implementing the generateInventory(), render(), and 
loadListeners() methods. 

This library is based off of developers directly editing the inventory
instance to allow for complete control of the UI.
